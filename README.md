# Mixify

A Spotify playlist generating application. Designed with the intent of helping friends and family create designated playlists for gatherings and trips.

Have you ever wanted to create a playlist, mixtape, or CD for your family or friends while going on a trip? One that you could all listen to in the car and equally enjoy together?

Mixify aims to tackle this problem. Using Spotify's API, Mixify takes input playlists from different users. Users can supply any playlist of their choosing, ideally one that will reflect their true music preferences/taste.

Mixify incorporates different playlists and conducts analysis of each playlist's traits, including danceability, tempo, energy, valence, etc. It uses these metrics to formulate a resulting playlist that will equally incorporate each input playlist with the intent that the final product will appeal to all members of the party. The final product will contain songs that each user may recognize from their respective playlists as well as suggesting new ones based on their listening tastes.

Mixify in use:

Here, I have four vastly different playlists. The playlists consist of old school hip-hop music, a blend of jazz, indie/dream rock, and a mix of Korean and American modern hip hop.
